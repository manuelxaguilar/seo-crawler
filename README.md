# seo-crawler
Simple node.js SEO content crawler for SPAs using Puppeteer

## TODO
Documentation and tests need to be added. This will be done shortly.

Also, currently working on making the module more robust by adding the following (among others):

* Make sure this works with multiple Node frameworks
* Ask if user wants to use cache or crawl every single time
* Update cached routes that have been modified
* Make more stuff configurable (cache time, for instance)
* Dynamic database content handling

All suggestions to improve this module are welcome.
